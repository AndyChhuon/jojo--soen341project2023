## Objective

Develop a job applications website, using AGILE methodology.

## Project

The jobs applications process can be cumbersone in many cases. All Software Engineers have their complaints about having to create a new WorkDay account for every company they apply to. On the employer's side, it is difficult and crucial to find the perfect candidate for open positions.
