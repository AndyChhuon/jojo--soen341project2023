            <p>Greetings User</p>
            <h2>introduction to jojo's terms of service</h2>
            <p>Each time you access or use jojo’s online and/or mobile services and websites, including any jojo
                mobile application and browser extension or plugin, regardless of where it is downloaded from
                (collectively, the “jojo Apps”), and any software, service, feature, product, program and element
                (including e-mail messages, notifications, and other messages) provided by or on behalf of Indeed on or
                in connection with such services or websites (collectively, the “Site”), including any products,
                programs, and services described in these Terms of Service
            </p>
            <h2>for job seekers:</h2>
            <p>
                Jojo may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content,
                including links to third-party websites (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through jojo’s search results or
                otherwise through the Site. Searching for Job Ads on jojo is free for Job Seekers. jojo displays Job Ads
                based on a combination of compensation paid by employers to jojo and relevance, such as search terms,
                and other information provided, and activities conducted on jojo. While jojo may in some circumstances
                be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep jojo job search free for Job Seekers, all Job
                Ads are considered advertising.
            </p>
            <p>
                Job Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control; you acknowledge
                and understand that jojo has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any
                conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site.
                For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a
                particular job, although jojo endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site. If you leave the
                jojo Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that
                third-party. Except for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked
                from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. Jojo has no obligation to screen any Job
                Ads, or to include any Job Ads, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any
                Job Ads from the Site or your search result without any obligation to provide reasoning for removal or
                exclusion. You understand and agree that jojo has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Ads.
                We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any
                Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user. Jojo assumes no
                responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality,
                reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, or other information submitted by any Employer or other
                user.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you initiate a job application on a website operated by an Employer or its applicant tracking
                system, jojo may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit
                using automated means, such as via Application Programming Interfaces (API), cookies and web beacons.
                The information collected includes, for example, information about job listings you viewed and job
                applications you started and completed. An Employer who uses tracker functionality is required under
                this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable
                law. However, you acknowledge and agree that jojo has no control over such an Employer or its website.
                You agree to jojo’s use of, and receipt of information from, any such tracker functionality.
            </p>
            <h2>for employers:</h2>
            <p>
                When you access or use the Site in your capacity as an employee or other representative of an Employer,
                or if you create an jojo account on behalf of an Employer, you represent and warrant that you have the
                authority to bind the Employer to this Agreement. When you create an account on behalf of an Employer,
                the account belongs to the Employer, and you acknowledge that any and all information that you provide
                jojo through the account, such as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to the
                Employer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”). A Linked
                Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admins”) of an Employer account invites other
                users to the same account. Admin(s) can provide these other users varying levels of access and
                functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site, such as accessing account data,
                including candidate Personal Data, contained in the account of the user who initiated the invite, or
                purchasing services from jojo under such account. If you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several
                Roles, you represent to jojo that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have
                the authority to allow this data and access to be shared. You further agree to indemnify and hold
                harmless jojo from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations,
                losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and
                costs) that result from the sharing of this data, access to your account, and any purchases made under
                your account. When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any
                or all account information, such as: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within
                the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access. When using
                a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may also have the ability to purchase jojo
                products under your account, and you agree that you are responsible for the payment of all such
                purchases made. If you accept another user’s invitation to link your Employer account to their Employer
                account, you acknowledge that any and all information about your activity in your Employer account, such
                as the actions you take and when you take them, will be visible to all linked users. Linked Account
                users will not be able to see your activity, such as your job searches, applications or preferences or
                your jojo Profile information, contained in your Job Seeker account. You may visit your account settings
                at any time to unlink your account. The Admin assigned to an Employer account may also unlink any user
                from that Employer account at any time, and may be notified if your Linked Account is used to login from
                too many devices.
